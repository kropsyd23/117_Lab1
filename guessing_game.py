    Runs one session of the guessing game.
    The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100.
    The player has 5 tries to guess the number correctly.
    After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess
    was too high or too low. If the player runs out of tries, the
    correct number is revealed.
